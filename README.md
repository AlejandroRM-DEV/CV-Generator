# CV Generator

This project was born out of the pressing need my brother faced when trying to create his curriculum vitae (CV) at a time when he lacked access to a computer and a suitable template. Motivated by this situation, I embarked on the creation of a project designed to provide an agile and efficient solution that allows any individual to generate his or her own CV in a short period of time.
